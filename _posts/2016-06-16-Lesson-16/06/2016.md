Lesson 16/06/2016

In today's lesson we started to create our microbit games with our partners. We had to use our planning sheet and our flowchart to help us. First we had to pick a section to work on, so we pick our start. First we had to create a variable called score to keep the score throughout the game. So we created one and then set it to 11 because that is the maximum score you can get by adding up 10 and 1 bonus question. Then after that we did microbit say and we got it to say the controls A=true and B=False and A and B= next question. Then we got it to say the question. We then did if button A pressed show smiley face and add 0 to the global score and if button B presses show unhappy face and -1 off global scores. Then only problem was that we had something that had to be in something else but wasnt so it never minused 1 or added 0 onto global score.
