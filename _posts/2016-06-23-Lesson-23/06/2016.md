Lesson 23/06/2016

In today's lesson me and my friend we carried on creating our microbit games like usual while some other boys got their blogs fixed because we all need to submit our blog page to mr Keen that day. So i carried on creating my microbit game while my friend fixed his blog post. When he got back i still hadnt improve whats so ever on the game because we were stuck on a very hard problem. So i asked Mr Keen if there was a certain block the buttonApressed need to go in he said no and then explain my to the whole class because he thought it will help everyone. So he explain you should mainly use the block i said above in a while loop because otherwise it would be very hard to press the a button at the exact right time he then said to use the event press A and the event press B and so on because it itself is a while loop. I think the Mr keen gave us was very useful and just now have put it to use and fixed the problem.
