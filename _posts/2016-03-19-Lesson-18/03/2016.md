Lesson 18/03/2016

In the lesson we learnt what makes a presentation that you are the person who gives the presentation the flavour not the presentation itself because it would be very boring just to read exactly what was on the board, look down at the floor and mumble the whole speech. Instead you need to give it the flavour by this i mean just put some small notes on the board not the whole speech, give your audience lots of eye contact and speak proudly. After this he ask us to sign into a website called Prezi which will help us to create presentation in a completely different way to microsoft powerpoint. So we tried it out and just put whatever we could into the presentation so we know where everything is for next lesson.
