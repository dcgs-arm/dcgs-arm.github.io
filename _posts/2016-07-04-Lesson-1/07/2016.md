Lesson 1/07/2016

In today's lesson we got our microbits at the start of the lesson, what we have been waiting for, for ages. When we got them we got to quickly try them out for the first part of the lesson. When you plugged the battery in the microbit was programed to give a little short first game before we had to go and make our own. After that we started the proper lesson which was to talk about social media. The first question was what are some of the main things social media is used for good and bad? we answered things like jobs, chatting, catching up and making friends for the good things and for the bad things we answered things like pawn, sexting and cyberbullying. The next question was what things are we afraid of and we answered sexting and pawning. For homework we had to read a news article on sexting and Revenge Pawn and show them on our blog.
