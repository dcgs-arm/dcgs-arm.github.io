    <td>Today, me and my friend dhilan did not work very well together because we were working separately. This meant that we were doing things in half the pace we should have been doing it in if we were working together. But near the end after a bit of a telling off we started to work together and we upped the pace.</td>

    <td>Our habit we need to work on is working together and this will increase the amount of learning we get done a lesson even though we already get quite a bit done already.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson we will work together so things like solving problems will be done in half the time it normally takes one of us to do it in.</td>
