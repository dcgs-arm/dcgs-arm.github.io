    <td>In the lesson today i had to leave 20 minutes into the lesson to go and play a rugby match (which we won 60-5 !!). This all meant that i did do much but we sped through the second last exercise and I thought we had finished but it turned out we had half another page =(. So couldn't see what i knew it was going to do. The next day i caught up with my partner and he explain what he did the rest of the exercise.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Well since i was at a rugby match i wasn't able to do much this lesson. So maybe i can play really badly next match and i can get put out of the "A" team so i don't miss the lesson (JOKES).</td>

    <td>Next lesson since there is no sports fixtures i will be able to do the whole lesson and i will also carry on doing everything i did in the other lessons.</td>
