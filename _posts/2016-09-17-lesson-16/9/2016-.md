  <tr>
    <td>I think time this week was all that limited our learning because me and Dhilan this week worked on working better together. If we keep this up we will do many exercises. If I had to be very picky i would say we would probably need to work a bit more on not trying the same thing over again. But this lesson we only did that once.</td>
