In today's lesson we learnt about all the different types of social media. For example and type of social media can be a painting or texting. We went around to everyone and ask them questions like do you have a computer or do you have a twitter account. For some of the questions it was really easy to find someone who lets say had a computer but it was really hard to find anyone who had a twitter account.

Later on in the lesson we watch an AD for a new car and we learnt how to find the target audience of the video, the subtext which is not the main reason of the AD but something that has a meaning but in a way only if you look hard you will find and the last one the untold story video.
