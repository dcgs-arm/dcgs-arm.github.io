    <td>This lesson i made sure not to miss all the different punctuation and capital letters, this enable me to go faster than i did last lesson. I also made sure i read everything on the side so later on i know what it does. Also when we got into the lesson we went straight on without having a talk and throughout the rest of the lesson there wasn't any other things we needed to know.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think even though i was reading everything in the top of the left column i wasn't taking it all in because i was trying to be the first to finish. I think also because i was trying to finish first i was overlooking simple question and starting to get frustrated even though all i had done wrong was forget to type "print" in.</td>
