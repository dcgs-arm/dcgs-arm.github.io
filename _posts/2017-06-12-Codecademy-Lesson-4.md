    <td>This lesson set a target at the beginning and made sure i reached it. I was stuck on the last part of pyglatin and finally figure it out it was quite simple once you understand what you need to do after that i went quite quickly through then i got stuck on one but then i slowly went through all of the code and look for anything out of place that might be the reason why my code didn't work. I found two things one was a small letter when it was meant to be a capital letter and the other was some speech marks that were around a word so it was a string when it was meant to be a variable after i change these two mistakes the code work and i carried on working at a steady pace.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think sometimes i rushed a bit too quickly through so i made silly mistakes like the one above also i sometimes forgot some of the stuff i learnt earlier on in the lesson so i had to go back through the lesson i had done i find out what i needed to know. That wasted valuable time i could be using to do other exercises</td>

    <td>Next time i will do the exercises slowly so i remember the details and so i don't make any silly mistakes the next time.</td>
