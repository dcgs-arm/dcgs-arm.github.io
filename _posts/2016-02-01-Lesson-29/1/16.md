Lesson 29/1/16

In the lesson today we learnt about all the different reasons for and against there are probably equal amounts of reasons, there is also two reasons which can go on both sides which is known by everybody using that social media and sex.

I think in the lesson what went well was that i payed attention to the teacher and i could probably name most of the different reasons for and against social media 

I think next lesson i can do better by putting my hand up and not saying er and um in the sentence.
