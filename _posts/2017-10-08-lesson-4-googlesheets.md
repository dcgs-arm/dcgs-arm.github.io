    <td>This lesson we started to learn iserror and isblank this help us to do two things the first which i understand is when something is blank or error show zero for the others things that need to do calculations with it otherwise the others things will show an error has occur. The other things we need to do i still don't understand i have done about 35 minutes trying to figure it out. What we have to do is do the discount sheet on another page in seems easy because all you have to do is what i did for the stock list but it doesn't work like that.</td>
