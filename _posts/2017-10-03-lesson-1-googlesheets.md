    <td>Our teacher told us at the beginning of the lesson that we would be learning how to use google sheets. I was excited because i had never learnt google sheets before and only knew that it was very useful for grouping data.  </td>

    <td>What i did well in the lesson</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think i listened well and understood the different things we learnt in the lesson especially the vlookup because it took me about 2 minutes to do that. I think i grasped everything in the lesson and am looking forward to next lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What i did badly in the lesson</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Some of the questions i asked were silly because i shouldn't need my teacher to do my work i need to do it and preserve myself because then i know i have learnt something not just copied him. Also i shouldn't be afraid to put my hand up if i don't know what he means and also when he asks if we understand i shouldn't look around the classroom to see what everyone else i doing i should be truthful.</td>
