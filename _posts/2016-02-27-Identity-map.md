Lesson 26/02/2016

When i was drawing out my identity map it was fun since it made me think about things like what media's do you actually use and what are some of your future goals what i haven’t thought about that much. When i was putting some information in I made sure that the information wasn’t to personal but still would tell my friends all about me. When people were looking at my identity map i wasn’t scared since i had made sure the information i put was’t personal or embarrassing. When commenting on other people’s Identity maps i felt happy since it was a new way of getting to see other people maps and it was fun being anonymous so no one knew who was who except for some people’s handwriting. I find this way a bit better than speaking directly to people because as i said above you are anonymous and also if you are talking to someone who is your friend you are most likely to change the feedback to something good if it is actually not very good. It was really fun getting feedback from people since no one really said the same, some were funny and someone on mine noticed that i had actually spelt my own name wrong!!!!! This process is different to commenting to people online because in this process you can't swear or do other rude words. This thing has kind of helped me to when in the future i am posting not to post anything racists or very personal to me. There aren't any changes i will make to my social media since i don't use any. These six lesson on social media have changed what i have use to think about them because i never knew that what you post in your early days can totally affect your life when you are older. This did change how i was going to use social media since i actually never was going to plan to use social media at all. So in total i have found all these lessons we have done on social media very helpful.
