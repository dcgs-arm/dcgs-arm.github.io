22/1/16 lesson

In lesson we learnt that some things in fantasy and reality are different to what people actually look like, what they act like and what they do. We then got ask questions and if we agreed went to one side of the room and if we disagreed we go to the other side of the room.

After that we watch how people like mcdonald's advertise their burgers buy taking a very long time to get the burger showing everything in it but in real life they just dump everything in the burger not trying to make it look nice but it still taste the same as the other one. Then we watched how people advertising don't actually look the same in real life they have just edited what they look like. Then last we found out that people with millions watching them don't act like they do in real life.
