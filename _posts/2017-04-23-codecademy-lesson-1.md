    <td>I made sure i read all of the explanations so when i came across it later which was inedible. I learnt to always do this because at my old school we did a much simpler coding  thing but i went through it really quickly wanting to be the first to finish and in the end when we had to make our own games i didn't know what to do</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My habit i need to work on is scruffy typing. Mostly it is tiny things that make a difference like capital letters. Eg true without a capital is a variable but True with a capital is boolean meaning yes or no. The reason i normally don't use a capital is when i texted and also the first term with the fuse boxes you barely ever needed to put capitals on the words because it didn't matter</td>

    <td>So next lesson i will make sure my typing is not scruffy meaning i won't have to go back over my work and check, wasting time giving me more time to learn more stuff.</td>
