    <td>This lesson our teacher started to teach us the more coding part of google sheets by adding the cost for delivery, vat, sub-total, discount and grand total. To do this we used the term if and left. First of all we made the sub total which was easy and did in a few seconds. The next few parts were more difficult. First of all i did the vat which was adding up the sub total, delivery and the discount and then timesing it by 0.2. After that i did the grand total which was just adding up everything together. Now i got on to the tricker part of delivery and discount. I started with the delivery which used the if statement to make sure if you are using x amount of money you have to pay x amount of money for the delivery, obviously the higher the price the less delivery. Now that i had done that i did the discount, i started by giving different starting letters different discounts. I then made a box where you type in the discount code. This box then checked if the discount was valid by checking the two digits numbers to the left of the box and if it was a real discount it would do that percent of the subtotal and take it off zero, After that the lesson was done.</td>

    <td>I think i need to get better at my typing this has carried on from last year and has slowed me down a lot because when i type fast i missed spelt a lot of letters so it slowed me down a lot.</td>
