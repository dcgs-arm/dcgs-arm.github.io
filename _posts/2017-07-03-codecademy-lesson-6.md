  <tr>
    <td>I still need to remember not to be sloppy with my typing especially looking out for typing errors and missing capital letters. This can lead to less work being completed. Also I cannot get distracted by others members of the class messing around because that will lead to me completing less work in the lesson. This means that I will fall behind in the homework leaving me with more to do next lesson.</td>
