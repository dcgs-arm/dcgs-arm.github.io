    <td>At the start of the lesson our teacher ask us if any of us had a understanding of what cryptography was. Only one person had a vague idea so he made us look it up and understand what is was. We then found out that cryptography was when you are either solving a code or making a code up. He then explained to us how to do cryptography in google sheets which is very simple. First you have create the code with what everything stands for some simple codes are only shift one meaning if their is an A it means B or if there is a M it means N. After we created our code we named the range and used Vlookup to get what we need the rest was quite simple until you had each letter in each box next to each other and you need it all in one box. He taught us how to use the term concatenate which put everything in the box easily.</td>
