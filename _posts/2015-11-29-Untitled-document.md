My blog

In this lesson i learnt how to create my own blog. The way i did this was going through the different first we went on github and created a username and password. Then we went and and fork and downloaded a repositories

after that we went on google docs and typed something down and change the title. After that we went to add-ons and clicked on gabriel and start publishing, we then went down to your github repos and click on the black arrow next to our name and scrolled down to where it said post and click that box. Then last of all went down to where it said publish and click on that and viewed it.
