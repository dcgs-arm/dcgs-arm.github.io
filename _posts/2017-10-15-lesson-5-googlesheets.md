    <td>This lesson we started to learn about the different types of business costs. We started off by list as many as possible eg. different types of tax, payrollâ€¦ we then started to try and figure out how to make a sheet with the amount we pay them either wages or salary. I then ran into a few problems and didn't finish that part of it. Our teacher then taught us how to add our spreadsheet to our blogs and set us the homework of doing it.</td>
