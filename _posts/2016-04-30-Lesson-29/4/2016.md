Lesson 29/4/2016

In today's lesson we started off by go to the front and watching a small clip from Harry Potter about the sorting hat. After that video we thought that if that hat was a computer what would be going through its head. We said the input would be the thoughts of the wizard the hat is on and the output would be the hat saying what house he is in. Now that we knew what we are trying to make we did a tutorial on how to make it we followed it and near the end of the lesson we finish we then also change it to on shake and changed all the houses to the ones at Challoners. After that in the last ten minutes, our teacher told us we had to create the sorting hat again but this time we had to make the sorting hat on Java scripts and if we didn't finish it class we did it for homework.
