Lesson 15/04/16

In today's lesson we look at one of our friends presentations and about the how the first computers first came around. We look over all the good points on how it is good to use bullet points and not huge chunks of text also how you should always check over your work for any punctuation you left out or capital letters instead of just being lazy and not checking. Then we look at a boy in the other class whose presentation wasn't very good since he had missed lots and lots of punctuation and Capital letters, copied and pasted most of his paragraphs, had not bothered to put all the stuff in the chronological order and had put some of the people down twice. Then after we had watch the two presentations we went on our IT google classroom and type one thing in chat to improve your own presentation.
