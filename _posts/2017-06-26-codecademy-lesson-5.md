    <td>I made sure i read all of the explanations so when i came across it later i would be able to complete it. I made sure i did this because last lesson i didn't do it and got stuck. Also i made sure my typing was not sloppy, so i didn't waste valuable time having to look over everything again to find out all i did wrong was forget a s or forget to do a capital letter instead of a lowercase letter.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think even though i was reading everything in the top of the left column i wasn't taking it all in because i was trying to be the first to finish. I think also because i was trying to finish first i was overlooking simple question and starting to get frustrated even though all i had done wrong was forget to type "print" in.</td>
